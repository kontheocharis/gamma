## What is NAV & CNAV?

Net Asset Value (NAV) = How much the company is intrinsically worth / share  

CNAV (Conservative Net Asset Value) = How much the company is intrinsically worth (assuming that only property, land and cash are considered as 'real assets') / share  



## Calculations of Ratios

Debt-to-equity ratio = (shortterm_debt + longterm_debt) / total_equity
Market capitalization = share_price * total_outstanding_shares

EPS_estimated = (net_income*0.9) / total_outstanding_shares     # Assuming that 10% of net income was given out as preferred dividends, since I don't have the exact figure
Price-to-earnings ratio = share_price / eps_estimated

CNAV = (cash + 0.5*ppe - total_liabilities) / total_outstanding_shares  # Assuming that (property investments + land) is 50% of PP&E since I don't have exact figures
NAV = (total_assets - total_liabilities) / total_outstanding_shares
ROI = (sell_share_price - buy_share_price) / buy_share_price
